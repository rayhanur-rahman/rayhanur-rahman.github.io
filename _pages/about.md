I am a Ph.D. candidate in North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA. My research interests are software engineering and cybersecurity, focusing on mining actionable intelligence from opensource knowledge bases for software and security practitioners to design proactive defenses. I rely on a wide range of techniques,
such as, natural language processing, machine learning, static analysis, and grounded theory-based approaches. As a first author, my research has been published at top venues such as EMSE, ACM CSUR, and ICSME. Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research as a research intern. 

Before that, I was a lecturer at Institute of Information Technology (IIT), University of Dhaka (DU). I completed M.Sc. in Software Engineering from IIT, DU, with thesis on scalable resource provisioning in cloud computing. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology (major in software engineering) from the same institute. 

Please reach out if you are interested in discussing my research, proposing new ideas, or collaborating.
