I am an Assistant Professor at The University of Alabama in the Department of Computer Science. I have obtained my doctoral degree in computer science from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA. My research interests are software engineering and cybersecurity, focusing on mining actionable intelligence from open-source knowledge bases for software and security practitioners to design proactive defenses. I rely on a wide range of techniques, such as natural language processing, machine learning, static analysis, and grounded theory-based approaches. As a first author, my research has been published at top venues such as ACSAC, EMSE, ACM CSUR, and ICSME. Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research as a research intern. 

Before that, I was a lecturer at the Institute of Information Technology (IIT), University of Dhaka (DU). I completed an M.Sc. in Software Engineering from IIT, DU, with a thesis on scalable resource provisioning in cloud computing. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology (major in software engineering) from the same institute. 

I am actively looking for prospective students to join my research. Please reach out if you are interested in discussing my research, proposing new ideas, or collaboration.
